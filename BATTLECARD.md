# Battlecard: B2M Solutions Elemez vs SOTI XSight

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-18
**Competitor:** B2M Solutions (Elemez Mobile DEX platform)
**Honeywell OEM Name:** Operational Intelligence
**Type:** Mobile Analytics / DEX Platform (NOT an MDM)
**Threat Level:** Medium (Analytics competitor, complementary to MDM)

---

## 1. What is B2M Solutions?

**B2M Solutions** (UK-based, founded 2002) provides **Elemez** — a Mobile Digital Employee Experience (Mobile DEX) platform for monitoring mobile device health.

**Honeywell Partnership:** Honeywell OEMs Elemez as **"Operational Intelligence"** for their devices. In Feb 2026, Honeywell announced B2M support for **non-Honeywell devices** (Zebra, Datalogic, GETAC, Panasonic).

**Critical Point:** This is an **analytics/monitoring tool only**. It tells you *what's wrong* but cannot *fix it*.

## 2. B2M Elemez Products

| Product | What It Does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Battery Essentials** | Predict battery failure, monitor health, reduce unnecessary swaps |
| **Core** | Real-time holistic analytics for devices, apps, networks |
| **API/Integrations** | Export data to Power BI, Tableau, custom dashboards |

**Supported Platforms:** Android 8.1-15, Windows 10/11
**Supported Manufacturers:** Zebra, Honeywell, Datalogic, GETAC, Panasonic

## 3. SOTI vs B2M: Quick Comparison

| Capability | SOTI (MobiControl + XSight) | B2M Elemez |
|:-----------|:----------------------------|:-----------|
| **MDM/Management** | ✅ Full MDM | ❌ Analytics only |
| **Remote Control** | ✅ Industry-leading | ❌ None |
| **App Deployment** | ✅ Full lifecycle | ❌ None |
| **Device Analytics** | ✅ XSight | ✅ Elemez |
| **Battery Analytics** | ✅ Predictive | ✅ Predictive |
| **OS Updates** | ✅ E-FOTA control | ❌ Monitoring only |
| **Security Policies** | ✅ Kernel-level | ❌ None |
| **Works Without MDM** | ❌ (is the MDM) | ✅ Standalone |
| **API Access** | ✅ SOTI ONE API | ✅ Elemez API |

**Bottom Line:** B2M is a **point solution** for analytics. SOTI is a **complete platform** for management + analytics + support.

## 4. Kill Shots (Where SOTI Wins)

### Kill Shot #1: "They See Problems, We Fix Problems"
```
"Elemez is like a smoke detector — it tells you there's a fire.
SOTI XSight is the fire department — we come in and put it out."
```
**Use When:** Customer asks about B2M's device health dashboards.
**Counter:** B2M can tell you a device has a failing battery. SOTI can push a profile to disable that device, notify the swap station, and reroute the worker — all automatically.

### Kill Shot #2: "Analytics Without Action is Just Reports"
```
"B2M gives you beautiful dashboards. Then what?
You still need an MDM to actually DO something about it.
SOTI gives you both — the visibility AND the control."
```
**Use When:** Customer is considering B2M as a standalone purchase.
**Counter:** Every B2M deployment still requires an MDM. Why pay for two platforms when SOTI does both?

### Kill Shot #3: "Remote Control is Non-Negotiable"
```
"B2M can report that a frontline worker's device is frozen.
SOTI can remote in and fix it in 30 seconds without a truck roll."
```
**Use When:** Customer has distributed workforce / field service.
**Counter:** Calculate the cost of one truck roll ($150-300). SOTI pays for itself on the first remote fix. B2M can't do this.

### Kill Shot #4: "One Platform, One Vendor"
```
"B2M + MDM = two vendors, two contracts, two support teams, two dashboards.
SOTI = one platform, one throat to choke, one bill."
```
**Use When:** Customer is price-sensitive or worried about vendor sprawl.
**Counter:** Consolidation reduces complexity. SOTI XSight does what B2M does + the MDM on top.

## 5. Vulnerabilities (Where We Lose)

### Vulnerability #1: Customer Already Has MDM, Just Wants Analytics
**Scenario:** Customer has Intune/Jamf/Workspace ONE and just wants better battery analytics.
**Counter:** "If you're buying analytics anyway, why not get the platform that comes with remote control built in? XSight gives you B2M's features PLUS the ability to fix problems remotely."

### Vulnerability #2: "We Don't Need Management, Just Visibility"
**Scenario:** Customer has field techs managing devices manually, doesn't see MDM value.
**Counter:** "That's exactly why you need SOTI. You're paying people to manually manage devices. We automate that AND give you the visibility B2M promises."

### Vulnerability #3: Multi-Vendor Device Fleet (Zebra + Honeywell + Datalogic)
**Scenario:** Customer has mixed fleet and B2M supports all of them with one analytics dashboard.
**Counter:** "SOTI also supports all those manufacturers. One MDM, one analytics platform, no fragmentation."

## 6. Sales Scripts by Scenario

### Scenario A: Customer Considering B2M for Battery Analytics
```
REP: "I see you're looking at B2M for battery health monitoring.
     Solid choice for visibility. Quick question though — when a battery
     is about to fail, how do you actually replace it?"

[Let them describe manual process]

REP: "Here's what SOTI XSight does differently. We don't just tell you
     a battery is failing. We can automatically:
     - Notify the user
     - Create a service ticket
     - Direct them to the nearest swap station
     - Track the swap completion

     That's analytics with ACTION. B2M gives you half the picture."

CLOSE: "Let me show you a 2-minute demo of XSight automated workflows."
```

### Scenario B: Customer Already Has MDM, Adding B2M
```
REP: "So you're adding B2M on top of [their MDM]. That makes sense for
     better analytics. But here's the thing — you're paying two vendors
     for what SOTI does in one platform.

     Have you looked at what XSight provides compared to B2M?"

[Compare feature-for-feature]

REP: "Same analytics. PLUS remote control. PLUS the MDM you already have.
     The question is: do you want to consolidate or add complexity?"

CLOSE: "Let's do a TCO comparison: [their MDM] + B2M vs. SOTI alone."
```

### Scenario C: Customer Is Honeywell Shop
```
REP: "If you're running Honeywell devices, their Operational Intelligence
     (which is B2M under the hood) is a natural fit for device health.

     But you still need an MDM. And if that MDM isn't SOTI, you're missing
     out on the industry's best remote control and Samsung/Honeywell integration.

     Here's the play: Keep OpIntel if you want. But let SOTI be the
     management layer that makes those insights actionable."

CLOSE: "SOTI + Honeywell OpIntel is a valid stack. Let me show you why
       SOTI should be the management layer."
```

## 7. Quick Reference Card

| Customer Says | You Say |
|:--------------|:--------|
| "B2M gives us device health" | "And we give you the power to act on it remotely" |
| "We already have an MDM" | "Great — but does it give you battery analytics AND remote control?" |
| "B2M supports all our device brands" | "So does SOTI — plus we can actually manage them" |
| "B2M is cheaper" | "B2M is analytics-only. You still need an MDM. We're both." |
| "We just need monitoring" | "Monitoring without action is just more reports your team ignores" |
| "We're a Honeywell shop" | "Perfect — SOTI is the best MDM for Honeywell devices" |

## 8. B2M Solutions Background (For Reference)

**Company:** B2M Solutions Ltd
**Founded:** 2002
**Headquarters:** Abingdon/Reading, UK
**North America:** Atlanta, Georgia
**CEO:** Gary Lee
**Funding:** Series A ($16.2M raised)
**Product:** Elemez (Mobile DEX platform)
**Business Model:** SaaS subscription, per-device pricing

**Key Insight:** B2M is a 20+ year old niche player. Their entire value prop is "MDMs leave gaps in analytics, we fill them." This admits they're a **complement to MDM, not a replacement**.

**Honeywell Relationship:** OEM partner. Honeywell resells Elemez as "Operational Intelligence."

---

## 9. Competitive Positioning Summary

**B2M Elemez is:**
- ✅ Good at: Battery analytics, device health monitoring, multi-vendor support
- ❌ Bad at: Everything that requires ACTION (remote control, deployment, security)
- ⚠️ Positioning: "Complements your MDM" = admission they can't replace it

**SOTI Position:**
- "We see what they see AND we can fix it remotely"
- "One platform, not two"
- "Analytics + management + remote control in one solution"

---

**Bottom Line for Sales:**
> B2M is a point solution that fills gaps in weak MDMs. SOTI XSight has no gaps. If the customer already has an MDM, position XSight as the upgrade that makes B2M unnecessary. If they're starting fresh, lead with "one platform does it all."
